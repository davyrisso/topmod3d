camera.h/cpp - only HandleMouseEvent() might require change - Done
    PerspectiveDisplay() - OpenGL calls
    HandleMouseEvent() - OpenGl, FLTK; both calls are included

GL_Window.h/cpp - init() and handle() may need changes, rest dont need - Done
    init() - includes both OpenGL and few glew related calls
    setShaders() - Only OpenGL calls
    setTexture() - Only OpenGL calls
    draw() - Only OpenGL calls
    handle() - Uses FLTK functions, calls other member functions which render using OpenGL

glErrorUtil.h/cpp - No changes.
    CheckErrorsGL()- Uses glew header file

GLSL.h/cpp - No changes.
    printOglError()- Uses glew header file
    printShaderInfoLog()- Uses glew header file
    printProgramInfoLog()- Uses glew header file

loadImage.h/cpp - Done.
    loadImage() - Uses FLTK for loading images. Needs the change, probably using QImage.

WeavingObject.h/cpp - Probably doesn't require modifiction, reconfirm it.
    DrawBaseMesh() - Only OpenGL commands
    DrawBezierPiece() - Only OpenGL commands
    DrawControlPolygon() - Only OpenGL commands
    DrawCylinder() - Only OpenGL commands
    DrawB_SplinePiece() - Only OpenGL commands
    YarnTrace() - Only calls to above fucntions commands, no explicit OpenGL calls

main.cxx
    timeout_cb() - OpenGl, FLTK; both calls are included
    cb_Select() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Texture() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Environment() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_6() - FLTK calls
    cb_Displace() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Samples() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Width() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Curvature() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_Bezier() - glWindow class member calls

    cb_width() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_write() - glWindow class member calls
    cb_flatten() - glWindow class member calls
    main() -  - glWindow class member calls; FLTK calls;

Have include Glew library availability after changes are done.
Integrity changes to combine things smoothly, this might take long time.


WHILE COMPILING THE SAME CODE IN LINUX, CUSTOMIZE
.PRO FILE FOR BOTH WINDOWS & LINUX COMPILATION  -  DONE
